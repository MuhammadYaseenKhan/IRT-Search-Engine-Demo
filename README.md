# IRT-Search-Engine-Demo

It is a small demo of how scarping works, for which I scraped Urdu news from UrduPoint.com using BeautifulSoup and save them in a JSON file.

And, Using the same news-dataset, I have also shown the TF-IDF-based text vectorization, and usage of cosine similarity for seaching and ranking similar docuemnts.

This is a Super Mini Search Engine.
